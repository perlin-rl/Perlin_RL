# Perlin RL

This Repo implements `WHITE`, `PINK`, arbitrary colored noises `COLOR_<beta>` and a range of Perlin based Noises such as `PERLIN_<speed>`, `DIRTYPERLIN_<speed>_<dirty_ratio>` and `HARMONICPERLIN_<speed>_<octaves>` as sb3 compatible noises.  
Most interesting code is in perlinrl/noise.py. perlinrl/perlinrl.py contains 'glue' to work with sb3.
